# Algorithms
This repository contains various algorithms which are implemented on Python Programming language.
The algorithms are as follows: 
1. Binary Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. Depth First Search
4. Merge Sort
5. Quicksort
6. Insertion Sort
7. Selection Sort
8. Kruskal's Algorithm
9. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
10. Dijkstra's Algorithm
11. Bellman Ford Algorithm
12. Kadane's Algorithm
13. Lee Algorithm
14. Flood Fill Algorithm
15. Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

All the algorithms are written on separate jupyter notebook with the explanation. I will continue to add more algorithms to it.
