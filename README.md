# Algorithms
This repository contains various algorithms which are implemented on Python Programming language.
The algorithms are as follows: 
1. Binary Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. Depth First Search
4. Merge Sort
5. Quicksort
6. Insertion Sort
7. Selection Sort
8. Counting Sort
9. Kruskal's Algorithm
10. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
11. Dijkstra's Algorithm
12. Bellman Ford Algorithm
13. Kadane's Algorithm
14. Lee Algorithm
15. Flood Fill Algorithm
16. Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
17. Union Find Algorithm
18. Topological Sort Algortihm
19. KMP Algorithm

All the algorithms are written on separate jupyter notebook with the explanation. I will continue to add more algorithms to it.
